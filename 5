In the morning light, I see your face
The way you smile, it lights up this place
I never knew love before you came
Now I'm forever yours, forever changed

Chorus:
Cause darling you're my everything
The beating of my heart, the air I breathe
I'm lost in your love, can't you see
You're the one I've been waiting for, my destiny

Verse 2:
I'll hold you close, through the darkest night
You're my shining star, my guiding light
I'll love you more, with every passing day
I'll be by your side, come what may

Chorus:
Cause darling you're my everything
The beating of my heart, the air I breathe
I'm lost in your love, can't you see
You're the one I've been waiting for, my destiny

Bridge:
I'll love you forever, I'll never let you go
You're my heart, my soul, my everything I know
I'll be yours, if you'll be mine
Together we'll chase the sun and chase the sky

Chorus:
Cause darling you're my everything
The beating of my heart, the air I breathe
I'm lost in your love, can't you see
You're the one I've been waiting for, my destiny

Outro:
I'll love you always, my darling
Forever and always, my love for you will never be fading
