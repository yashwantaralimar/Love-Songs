The love that makes my heart sing
I'll hold you close, forevermore
Cause darling, you're the one I adore

I hold you close, and I never doubt
That you're the one I want to spend my life with
Cause darling, you're my reason to live

The love that makes my heart sing
I'll hold you close, forevermore
Cause darling, you're the one I adore

Cause darling, you're the one I adore

Forever yours, forever mine
Cause darling, you are my everything.
